<h1>3D Object Viewer<h1> <br />

<h5>Welcome to the 3D Object Viewer repository! This project is an ongoing development of an interactive application designed to visualize and manipulate 3D objects in real-time. <br />
It uses OpenGL for rendering and Dear ImGui for a user-friendly graphical interface. <br />

Note: This project is still in progress. Features are being actively developed, and the codebase is subject to significant changes.
The objective is to integrate a variety of lights that can be manipulated by a user, Blinn-Phong shading and an access to having multiple objects with different shaders in the scene.<h5> <br />
